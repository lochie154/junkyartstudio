Here are some ideas of things I'd like to explore during the next six weeks. I might not necessarily get to them all, but they should provide me with a jumping-off point for what promises to be a meandering path forward.

**Note:** This is a living list; I will keep updating it as I have more ideas.

- A web app that allows the user to draw a spread of tarot cards
  - Use the {% extLink "Random.org random number api" "https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/" %}
  - Cards could be SVGs (perhaps generative)
  - Create a neat splash page that appears before you draw
  - Animate flipping the cards
    - Maybe you should have to flip each card by clicking on it
  - Figure out a decent layout for smaller screens
- Generative SVGs as {% extLink "asemic poetry" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing" %}
- Generative SVG truchet tiles
- A webpage that takes in a webcam feed and creates an ascii art version of the image (low resolution like a gameboy camera)
- Just create some fun animations
  - A shader with colorful gradient-mapped noise
- Pixel art cellular automata in the browser
- Playable generative mazes
- Play with {% extLink "hydra" "https://hydra.ojack.xyz/" %} more and look at the code
- Add dark mode to websites

#### General idas to explore and chew on

- Javascript, webGL, p5.js, three.js
- Web components
- Webcam input
- Progressive enhancement

#### Next steps

- ✅ Refresh my knowledge of javascript
- ✅ Port my webGL shader playground to {% extLink "the lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}
- Just start noodling around...

#### Note to self

- It's OK and valuable to "reinvent the wheel"
