Here are some ideas of things I'd like to explore during the next six weeks. I might not necessarily get to them all, but they should provide me with a jumping-off point for what promises to be a meandering path forward.

**Note:** This is a living list; I will keep updating it as I have more ideas.

- A web app that allows the user to draw a spread of tarot cards
  - Use the {% extLink "Random.org random number api" "https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/" %}
  - Cards could be SVGs (perhaps generative)
  - Create a neat splash page that appears before you draw
  - Animate flipping the cards
    - Maybe you should have to flip each card by clicking on it
  - Figure out a decent layout for smaller screens
- Generative SVGs as {% extLink "asemic poetry" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing" %}
- Generative SVG truchet tiles
- A webpage that takes in a webcam feed and creates an ascii art version of the image (low resolution like a gameboy camera)
- Just create some fun animations
  - A shader with colorful gradient-mapped noise
- Pixel art cellular automata in the browser
- Playable generative mazes
- ✅ Play with {% extLink "hydra" "https://hydra.ojack.xyz/" %} more and look at the {% extLink "code" "https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra-server" %}
- ✅ Add dark mode to a website

#### Tools and methods to explore

- Vanilla Javascript
- HTML canvas
- p5.js
- WebGL
- Three.js (?)
- Progressive enhancement

#### Next steps

- ✅ Refresh my knowledge of javascript
- ✅ Port my webGL shader playground to {% extLink "the lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}
- Just start noodling around...

#### Note to self

- It's OK and valuable to "reinvent the wheel"

#### References & Examples

- {% extLink "Web-based art" "https://www.newrafael.com/internet/" %} by Rafaël Rozendaal
- {% extLink "Ascii art webcam" "https://github.com/idevelop/ascii-camera" %}

- {% extLink "A webGL shader webcam filter" "https://github.com/bu3nAmigue/bu3npattern" %}

#### Things to read up about

- How to store cookies in the browser
- How to directly integrate with webGL
- The canvas element
- What is a web component and how to make & use them
- How to grab data from a webcam in a webpage
- Neural networks in image processing / pattern generation ({% extLink "Reference" "https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/" %})
