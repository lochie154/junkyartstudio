- Had a coffee chat with Piya. We discussed her monitoring project for the heap server cluster, and self-hosting projects in general. We both have thought about running a server from our home internet but have reservations about the security implications of doing so. Piya recommended that I talk to Stephen, who has a homelab and is experienced in such matters.
- Joined the Volitional Muscles workshop, where we all wrote out our ideas for what we want to work on, our reasons for wanting to work on those things, and the actionability or next steps of each one. I had a slight head start on the [list of ideas](#ideas) front, but it was helpful to think through the rest of it and come up with some action items. It also felt kind of good to cross certain things off my list and just say "I'm not doing that." Seeing my reasoning behind why I wanted to do things made it easier to cull some of them.
- Found some code references for certain things I want to do or learn, and added them to my [ideas list](#ideas). (Yes, I will keep linking to the [ideas list](#ideas) every time I mention it.) I also looked more deeply into p5.js and three.js. I think I would like to try to make some things by working more directly with the HTML canvas element and vanilla javascript, instead of having to load several megabytes of dependencies for my page and probably learn less fundamentals in the process. I even feel that way about the GLSL canvas tool that I used for the {% extLink "shaders page on the lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv/shaders" %}, even though it's comparatively small and lightweight.
- Had a chat with Emily, one of the RC faculty, who also led the workshop earlier. It turns out that she used to live in New Haven for a number of years as well. We talked about what brought me to Recurse Center at this point in my life, and my experience of the first week of my batch as a mostly-remote-but-occasionally-in-person participant.

#### To-do:

- Log off for the weekend and chill.
- When I return on Monday, delve back into the browser-based graphical things I want to research and build (as outlined in the [ideas list](#ideas)).
