- Had an afternoon coffee chat with Eric. We discussed his URL shortener project and the challenges of letting strangers use it, the messiness of the process of programming and getting a window into others' process through pairing, and the awesomeness of {% extLink "hydra" "https://hydra.ojack.xyz/" %}.
- Joined presentations, where people shared about:
  - A thing that lets you render three.js in react
  - A trippy generative p5.js sketch with lissajous curves, perlin noise, and poisson process
  - Building an e-bike
  - A pong game that gets rendered in a grid of favicons of browser windows with too many tabs open
  - Rendering images and video as colorful ascii art in the terminal with rust and FFmpeg
  - A very scalable database created by Google called "Spanner"
  - Making generative music using ideas from linguistics
  - Programs that can mutate and combine genetically (?)
  - A web app that lets you generate fictional Japanese city names
- Did a bit of javascript review
  - `const` and `let` were introduced in ES6 and both have a block scope. `var` is older and always has a global scope. The value of `let` can be changed, while a `const` can not be changed. Also, `var` can be redeclared, while `let` cannot. (w3schools links: {% extLink "`let`" "https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_let.asp" %} {% extLink "`const`" "https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_const.asp" %})
- Ported some fragment shaders I wrote a while ago to the lab. Also, I made the lab homepage read like a text adventure. ({% extLink "Visit the lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %} or jump straight to the {% extLink "shaders page" "https://lab.palomakop.tv/shaders" %})

#### To-do:

- Start noodling around with some of the ideas in my [ideas list](#ideas)
