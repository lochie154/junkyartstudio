- On Saturday, I ended up at the hub because I was in the city with nothing to do for a little while.
- Played a guessing game with a bunch of folks who were hanging out when I showed up. Also ended up having a more in-depth conversation with Reed afterwards.
- Added a fun animated gradient on link hover to {% extLink "The Lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}.
- Read about localStorage and sessionStorage and started implementing a dark mode toggle for {% extLink "The Lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}. I want to respect the user's color scheme preference when they first load the page, but also allow them to toggle it.
- On Sunday morning, while staying with my friend, I finished implementing the light switch on {% extLink "The Lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %} and improved the navigation with anchor links.
