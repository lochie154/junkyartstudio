- Started {% extLink "this Vue tutorial" "https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/" %} - so far I've got a dev server running with hot reload
- Finished building the {% extLink "mandelbulb page" "https://lab.palomakop.tv/mandelbulb/" %} on the Lab
- I was planning to join some of the career services calls but decided to take some time to organize myself and do some heads-down work instead
- Organized my to-do lists, notes, and resources. Feeling more clear about my next steps, but it's been another jam-packed week, so time for a break!
