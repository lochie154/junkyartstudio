- Joined the Monday Meditation call, where we did a very nice noting meditation on sounds. In the discussion afterwards, we ended up talking about sphere-packing and {% extLink "Indra's Net" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net" %}.
- Started doing {% extLink "this tutorial" "https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/" %} to deploy a basic Flask app to Heroku.
  - In the tutorial they have you deploy to Heroku via git, but instead I linked my Heroku app to a repo on Github so when I push to the main branch it will automatically deploy the app
  - Added {% extLink "Heroku Postgres addon" "https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql" %} for the database
  - Installed {% extLink "Postgres" "https://postgresapp.com/" %} on my mac for dev environment parity
  - References:
    - {% extLink "Set env vars in zsh" "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/356441/how-to-add-permanent-environment-variable-in-zsh" %}
- Got a bit tired of working with this dry database stuff so I decided to start downloading the tarot card images for my tarot app. I downloaded and cropped them all and renamed the files consistently; tomorrow will try some batch processing on them with imagemagick.
- I have a call scheduled for tomorrow for a potential job lead!
