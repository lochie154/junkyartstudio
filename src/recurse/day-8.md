- Joined the Remote Recurser Check-in call. We had a nice discussion facilitated by Emily.
- Added the Conway's Game of Life implementation I did in the pairing workshop with Irena to the {% extLink "p5.js page on The Lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv/p5/" %}.
- Joined the Creative Coding meetup and jammed for the rest of the afternoon on making mandelbulbs in Houdini with Timothy, Sophia, and Richard. I have never used Houdini before but there is a free version you can use to experiment, and it has advanced scripting capabilities to create and animate custom geometry and effects.

#### To-do:

- I'd like to get started with my tarot web app soon. The first thing I need to do is figure out what tech stack to use for it. Ruby on Rails seems like it would work well but it's a bit outdated...
- Do some leetcode coding exercises
