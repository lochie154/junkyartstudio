- Went to the Hub (Recurse Center's in-person location in Downtown Brooklyn). Received a key fob, a tour of the space, and a bagel. (I also drank some coffee, which I don't normally do and it made me feel slightly wired).
- Hung out and chatted with a bunch of folks, and joined a group that went to Xi'an Famous Foods around the corner for dumplings.
- Attended the Pairing Workshop. Worked with Irena on implementing Conway's Game of Life in p5.js ({% extLink "code link" "https://editor.p5js.org/irena.wang/sketches/PBkSSTDBF" %}). At the end of the time, we had a bug in our code, and then during the demo, we showed our code and people helped us debug it live.
- Took the metro north train back to New Haven. While on the train, I set up my new Laboratory site: {% extLink "lab.palomakop.tv" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}

#### To-do:

- âœ… Make a list of ideas to work on
- Start coding and exploring
