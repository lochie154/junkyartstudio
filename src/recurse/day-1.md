- Joined meetings for welcome and orientation, met some of the peers in my cohort and heard a bit about what they are interested in and planning to work on. I was excited to hear some overlap with my own interests and ideas.
- Took the metro north train to NYC (from my home in New Haven, CT). It's a ~2 hour train ride. I joined one of the zoom meetings while riding the train, which worked surprisingly well.
- Created this page to keep track of things I do and projects I work on during my batch.

#### To-do:
- Create a separate section of my website called "The Lab" to host web-based projects in progress!
