- Had a coffee chat with Basil. (Actually I was drinking tea so it was really a tea chat.) We discussed our project ideas, the parallels between modular video synthesis and shaders, and I learned about "metal" shaders. We plan to pair on webGL when I'm in the hub next week.
- Wrote a python script to get address data from Stripe, and format it as a CSV, for a batch of <a href="/zine-club">Zine Club</a> Mystery Objects that I need to ship.
- Met with Laura from RC about their career services offerings and my plans and goals for my work life in the future.
- Made plans to talk to or meet with a bunch of other folks in the next few days.
- Started compiling a list of ideas and things to do during my batch â€” I will share it here soon~
