  November 20th was the release of <i>Elmet Brae</i>, a community compilation of soundscapes/ambient/noise/drone from <a href="https://merveilles.town/about" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merveilles Town</a> members and friends. It includes an ambient piece I recorded while traveling in the national forests of the northwestern US, titled <i><a href="https://beldamrecords.bandcamp.com/track/paloma-kop-artemisia-grove" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Artemisia Grove</a></i>.

  The online community of Merveilles Town has been a calm, creative haven for me on the internet, and a place of mutual inspiration and encouragement, since I joined the mastodon server in 2022. It has been lovely to listen to everyone's musical contributions to this compilation and appreciate the town's unique personality and atmosphere.
