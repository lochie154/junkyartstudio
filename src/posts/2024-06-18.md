On Tuesday, June 18, I gathered with a few friends in an outdoor space behind a small gray barn which I helped renovate over the spring. As part of a party taking place that night, we set up a projector screen and a PA and brought out some music and video gear for a jam session that lasted well into the night. I pulled the excerpt below from our session, which features {% extLink "Snark", "https://snark.bandcamp.com/" %} on saxophone and electronics, {% extLink "ShmOoOo", "https://shm0o0o.bandcamp.com/" %} on synths and samplers, and {% extLink "Ben Kujawski", "https://physicalbooksandmedia.bandcamp.com/album/desert-crawl" %} on guitar, as well as myself on visuals. It was a memorable evening, and I look forward to my next opportunity to perform video synthesis outdoors.
