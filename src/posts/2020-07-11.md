  I was thrilled to have my work included in the livestreaming program for Coaxial Summer Series on Saturday, July 11. The series continues every Saturday at 9pm PDT through August, and is hosted by <a href="https://coaxialarts.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coaxial</a>, a wonderful media arts organization in Los Angeles. Since in-person events are not an option right now due to the pandemic, this kind of virtual programming is even more vital.
