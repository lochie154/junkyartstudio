On Saturday, March 27, I did a livestreamed performance for the 2021 edition of the <a href="https://www.aafilmfest.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ann Arbor Film Festival</a>. Several fellow {% extLink "Signal Culture", "http://signalculture.org" %} community members were also featured this year, including <a href="http://videoactiveavocado.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kit Young</a>, <a href="https://scottkiernan.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Kiernan</a>, and <a href="http://www.seeinginvideo.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jason Bernagozzi</a>.

*The Ann Arbor Film Festival is the oldest avant-garde and experimental film festival in North America, founded by George Manupelli in 1963. Internationally recognized as a premiere forum for independent filmmakers and artists, each year's festival engages audiences with remarkable cinematic experiences. The six-day festival presents 40 programs with more than 180 films from over 20 countries of all lengths and genres, including experimental, animation, documentary, fiction, and performance-based works.*
