On October 12, we hosted a {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} Video Artist Meetup at <a href="https://www.syzygysf.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Syzygy</a> in San Francisco, in collaboration with <a href="https://avclubsf.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AV Club</a>, a local art collective for technology-based performers. We set up an interactive demo of some of our gear, including <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrei's</a> gravity_waaaves, waaave_pool and artificial_life. Our friend <a href="https://www.seanrussellhallowell.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sean Russell Hallowell</a> also brought his self-built modular video synthesizer (and we had some fun sending signals back and forth between our systems).

Syzygy is a really nice community-run space, and the AV Club there is an awesome hub of algorave folks in the area. I had a great time meeting a bunch of new people, including <a href="http://art.sarahghp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah GHP</a>, a fellow video artist who I'd only known from online.
