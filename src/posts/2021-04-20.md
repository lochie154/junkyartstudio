  On April 20th, we had a community screening to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the founding of <a href="https://scanlines.xyz/" target="_blank">scanlines.xyz</a>!

  Last year, I teamed up with <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrei Jay</a>, <a href="https://cyberboy666.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cyberboy666</a>, and <a href="https://ojack.xyz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Olivia Jack</a> to create a new forum to discuss diy video and audio projects. Over the past year, the community has evolved, and we now maintain a chat platform, a custom livestreaming service, and a peertube video hosting setup, all on our own infrastructure. I really value having this community around experimental video art that's outside of the advertising-ridden hellscape of corporate social media.
