On October 5, we did a visiting artist workshop at University of Oregon in Eugene, for the class Digital Imaging taught by our friend <a href="https://www.kevinkripper.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kevin Kripper</a>. We discussed iterative processes, feedback loops &amp; recursion, and reaction-diffusion/Turing patterns in digital &amp; analog processes and in nature. The students learned how to generate their own Turing patterns from photos, like in the examples below.
