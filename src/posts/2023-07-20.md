On July 20, we led a {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} video art workshop at a public library in Minneapolis. With the help of our local artist friends, we were able to set up six stations for exploration of video feedback with cameras, processors, and mixers. Since Minneapolis has a thriving a/v art scene, there was a lot of interest, and many people came to participate. I also had an amazing time jamming with a bunch of people the following weekend.

Many thanks to our friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamadot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shawna Lee</a>, <a href="http://eriktinberg.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Erik Tinberg</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blindprophet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chris LeBlanc</a>, Charles Hainsworth, and others who helped out with things!
