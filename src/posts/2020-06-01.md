  Some friends and I got together and set up a new discussion forum for DIY A/V things called <a href="http://scanlines.xyz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scanlines.xyz</a>. So far, it's been a refreshing place to connect with friends and people with common interests, away from big corporate social media sites. It's hosted on our own server, and we also run a livestreaming server, chat, and video hosting platform, all using open source software.
