My work is included in *Metacognition*, an exhibit at Spring/Break Art Show, curated by Tali Hinkis and Robin Kang. It ran from March 3-9 in NYC.

*Metacognition: the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. This exhibition surrounds a conversation between a group of artists who employ meditative and repetitive processes to creatively navigate through the dimensional realms of reality. The physical, algorithmic, emotional, virtual, spiritual, and scientific planes are investigated through clever uses of technology and innovative combinations of the material and the digital.*
