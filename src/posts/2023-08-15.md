While camping in the national forests in Wyoming and Montana, I spent some time looking closely at the many forms of moss, lichen, fungi, and flora inhabiting the forest floor. Since much of my artwork draws inspiration from the intersection between the organic and the algorithmic, I decided to take a macro lens and try to document some of this wealth of fascinating tiny landscapes and patterns, for later reference and admiration. Here are some of my favorites.
