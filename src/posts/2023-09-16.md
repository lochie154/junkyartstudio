  On September 16, we were special guests at Video Mixer, a meetup and interactive demonstration of video art tools, hosted by <a href="https://ceti.institute/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CETI Institute</a> and <a href="https://synthlibraryportland.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Synth Library Portland</a>. It was great to hang out and chat with some local artists and tinkerers, and to set up a playground for folks to explore some of the tools and techniques we've developed!
