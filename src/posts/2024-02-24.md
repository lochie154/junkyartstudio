<p>
  On Saturday, February 24, Andrei and I (<a href="https://phaseshift.zone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Shift Collective</a>) created an interactive video installation at a pop-up event hosted by <a href="https://annaoxygen.cargo.site/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anna Oxygen</a> in a disused retail space at a dying mall in Ithaca, NY.
  </p>
<p>
  At the event, Anna performed an experimental run-through of <a href="https://annaoxygen.cargo.site/The-Shapes-We-Leave-Behind" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Shapes We Leave Behind</a>, a strange livestream performance in which she greenscreens herself, wearing various sculptural costumes created by collaborator <a href="http://fawnkrieger.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fawn Krieger</a>, into a surreal video-game-esque landscape filled with glitchy 3D scanned statues of herself, while also singing and performing electronic music.
  </p>
<p>
  The night ended with a dance party to 80s disco music, with people dancing inside the video feedback loop of our installation.
  </p>
<p>
  Anna was able to briefly take over this former storefront space in a mostly empty shopping mall, inserting herself and her artwork into an appropriately liminal venue during a sabbatical from her professorship. Thanks to Anna for inviting us to be a part of this unusual show.
