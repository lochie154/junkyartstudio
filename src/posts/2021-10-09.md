On Saturday, October 9th, we hosted a show at <a href="https://phasespace.nyc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Space</a> called *HYPERBOREALIS*! There were installations in our basement studio space, and a series of live performances in our outdoor yard/garage. I collaborated on a live performance that combined light art and experimental sound, along with Valeria Divinorum, Jonathan Sims, Max Coker, and Andrei Jay.
