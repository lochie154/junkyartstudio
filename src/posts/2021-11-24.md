  On Wednesday, November 24, I presented a virtual artist talk and screening for the Digital Dish series at Ljudmila Lab in Ljubljana, Slovenia! I talked about my recent piece, <i>Magnetic Field Recordings</i>, as well as my <i>Electromagnetic Earth</i> series and some of the concepts and inspiration behind it. We also had a discussion segment with fellow artist Ida Hiršenfelder (a.k.a. <a href="https://beepblip.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">beepblip</a>).
