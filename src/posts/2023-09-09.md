<p>
  On September 9, we led our <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Shift</a> <i>Intro to Live Visuals</i> workshop at Patchwerks, a synth boutique in Seattle. This was our biggest group so far on this tour, with almost 30 people attending. Luckily, we had assistance from local artists &amp; people from the video community, and everyone had an excellent time collaborating and exploring analog video feedback with cameras and mixers, optical effects, and liquids.
