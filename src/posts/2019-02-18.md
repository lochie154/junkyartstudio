From February 18 through March 9, my work was installed as part of *Performing Media Exhibition* at IU South Bend Gallery, in South Bend, Indiana. This exhibition was part of *<a href="https://www.performingmediafestival.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Performing Media Festival</a>*, and represented an international selection of artists focusing on real-time media, including Christopher Biggs, Ted Davis, Mathew Schlanger, James Connolly, Karl Erickson, Sara Goodman, Debora Bernagozzi &amp; Jason Bernagozzi, Kevin Kripper, Jonathan Gillie, Toby Kaufmann-Buhler, and myself.

A <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/326256931565021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reception and talk</a> was held on February 28, followed by the rest of the festival, including two nights of live performances.
