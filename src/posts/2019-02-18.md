  From February 18 through March 9, my work was installed as part of <i>Performing Media Exhibition</i> at IU South Bend Gallery, in South Bend, Indiana. This exhibition was part of <i><a href="https://www.performingmediafestival.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Performing Media Festival</a></i>, and represented an international selection of artists focusing on real-time media, including Christopher Biggs, Ted Davis, Mathew Schlanger, James Connolly, Karl Erickson, Sara Goodman, Debora Bernagozzi &amp; Jason Bernagozzi, Kevin Kripper, Jonathan Gillie, Toby Kaufmann-Buhler, and myself.
