On October 7, we led a {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} video art workshop at a private studio &amp; wood shop in Eugene, Oregon. Attendees were a mixed group with some experienced video artists and some beginners, so it was cool to see the more experienced folks sharing their knowledge and personal techniques. Many thanks to Josiah Martens for hosting the event and to Adam Sladek for providing video equiment and some cool kaleidoscopic mirrors!
