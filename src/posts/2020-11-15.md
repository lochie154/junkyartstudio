  On Sunday, November 15, I performed a collaborative a/v set with <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrei Jay</a>, which was livestreamed as part of <i>Vidicon</i>. This year was the second edition of Vidicon, and due to the pandemic, it took place entirely online, with performances by many wonderful video artists and friends. The set I played with Andrei was enjoyably eccentric. My favorite part was performing on musical saw while video of me was being processed through a slit scan frame buffer. We had a lot of fun! Additionally, the <a href="https://scanlines.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scanlines.xyz</a> team and I were able to contribute to the festival's video streaming and chat infrastructure, to help create an online venue independent from major social media sites and platforms.
