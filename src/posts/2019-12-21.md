I did a solo a/v set at the opening of <a href="http://www.fluxfactory.org/event/solstice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SOLSTICE</a>, an exhibition of light art works at Flux Factory, organized and curated by <a href="http://chromadetic.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Sims</a>. The opening took place on the night of the winter solstice, and the opening was marked by 4 a/v performances by me, <a href="https://www.testucollective.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Testu Collective</a>, <a href="http://www.maria-takeuchi.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ÉMU (Maria Takeuchi)</a>, and <a href="https://www.night-shining.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Shining</a>. The performances and installations of light works complemented each other amazingly and I was thrilled to be a part of it all.
