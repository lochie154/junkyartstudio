In August, I performed live visuals for two shows in the Hudson Valley. The first one was on August 21 at {% extLink "The Avalon Lounge", "https://www.theavalonlounge.com/" %} in Catskill, NY, where my video projections augmented the music of two electroacoustic duos: {% extLink "Lunar Slopes", "https://snark.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-hubbell-space-farm" %} (Snark & Jeff Rieger), who are local to the Hudson Valley, and {% extLink "Matthew Ryals", "https://www.matthewryals.com/" %} and {% extLink "Stephan Haluska", "https://stephanhaluska.wordpress.com/" %}, who were on tour together and who hail from NYC and Cleveland, respectively. It was great to return to this lovely and welcoming venue, and to get the opportunity to collaborate with friends, old and new. Here are few scraps of video footage from this show:

The second show, which I helped organize, was held at a private space in Kingston, NY. I performed visuals for sets by {% extLink "Snark", "https://snark.bandcamp.com/" %} (who also helped organize the show), {% extLink "The Spookfish", "https://thespookfish.bandcamp.com/" %}, and {% extLink "headfullofhammers", "https://www.instagram.com/headfullofhammers" %}. Bungey Colle, another co-organizer, was sadly unable to make it to perform.

Below are some visual artifacts from the shows.
