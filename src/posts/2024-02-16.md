On Friday February 16, I performed a collaborative audiovisual set with {% extLink "Matthew Ryals", "https://www.matthewryals.com/" %} at {% extLink "The Avalon Lounge", "https://www.theavalonlounge.com/show-calendar" %} in Catskill, NY. Matthew and I have collaborated before, so when I found out that he would be performing in the area, I eagerly joined the bill. Combining modular video synthesis and camera feedback, I was able to incorporate control voltage signal's from Matthew's audio synths, introducing synesthetic interaction between the sound and video.

Other performers included 
{% extLink "The Early", "https://theearly.bandcamp.com/" %} from Philadelphia, and {% extLink "Friends Meeting", "https://goingin.bandcamp.com/album/god-respects-us-when-we-work-but-loves-us-when-we-dance-going-in-023" %}, ambient duo project of Ben Seretan and M. Geddes Gengras. It was a lovely evening of dreamy experimental sound. At the end, The Early and Friends Meeting joined together for a rather epic jam. The show was also broadcast live on {% extLink "Wave Farm's WGXC", "https://wavefarm.org/listen" %}.
