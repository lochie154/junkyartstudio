  On Friday February 16, I performed a collaborative audiovisual set with <a href="https://www.matthewryals.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matthew Ryals</a> at <a href="https://www.theavalonlounge.com/show-calendar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Avalon Lounge</a> in Catskill, NY. Matthew and I have collaborated before, so when I found out that he would be performing in the area, I eagerly joined the bill. Combining modular video synthesis and camera feedback, I was able to incorporate control voltage signal's from Matthew's audio synths, introducing synesthetic interaction between the sound and video.

  Other performers included <a href="https://theearly.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Early</a> from Philadelphia, and <a href="https://goingin.bandcamp.com/album/god-respects-us-when-we-work-but-loves-us-when-we-dance-going-in-023" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Friends Meeting</a>, ambient duo project of Ben Seretan and M. Geddes Gengras. It was a lovely evening of dreamy experimental sound. At the end, The Early and Friends Meeting joined together for a rather epic jam. The show was also broadcast live on <a href="https://wavefarm.org/listen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wave Farm's WGXC</a>.
