On Saturday, March 5, I performed live visuals for <a href="https://ambient.church/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ambient Church</a>, featuring atmospheric music by <a href="https://www.sevwave.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Suzanne Ciani</a> and <a href="https://loriscacco.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lori Scacco</a>. The projection mapping was done by <a href="http://najork.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eric Epstein</a>, who created custom mattes of the space to allow us to activate the architecture with my morphing video feedback patterns and oscillations, mixed in with live video of Suzanne's Buchla performance. The quadrophonic sound system further spatialized the audiovisual experience. It was certainly a memorable show!
