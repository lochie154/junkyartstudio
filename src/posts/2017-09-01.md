  Today I have begun my week as Artist in Residence at <a href="http://signalculture.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Signal Culture</a>, an organization that runs an amazing residency program in Owego, NY. I am indescribably excited to experiment with this unique array of historic analog video devices and electronics!
