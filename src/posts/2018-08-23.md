  I performed an experimental A/V set as <i>sleepwalks</i>, as well as providing visuals for the rest of the acts, at this show at Trans-Pecos in Brooklyn. It was fun to collaborate with some touring artists from Minneapolis, and the collaborative set by Machine Girl and Bonnie Baxter (of Kill Alters) had people dancing so hard I felt as though the floor might collapse. For me, this show was a way to say goodbye to Brooklyn, as I prepared to move upstate for grad school.
