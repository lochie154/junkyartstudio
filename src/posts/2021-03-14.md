On Sunday, March 14, I performed at Testu Collective's ChaShaMa residency space in the Brooklyn Navy Yards. I performed a solo a/v set and then participated in our group jam session at the end. It was very nice to be able to collaborate with other artists in my local community, and we look forward to organizing more public events once that becomes possible.
