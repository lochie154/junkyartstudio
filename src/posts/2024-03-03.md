  On Sunday, March 3, my art collective, <a href="https://phaseshift.zone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Shift</a>, led an <i>Intro to Live Visuals</i> workshop at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_psychic_garden/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Psychic Garden</a> in Rochester, NY. Rochester has a strong DIY community, and many local folks found their way to the event, as well as a few from Buffalo and Alfred. We had a full house, but luckily we also had a few extra helping hands from <a href="https://ewb.studio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Evan</a> and <a href="http://landbuoy.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Max</a>.
  </p>
<p>
  The Psychic Garden is located inside a row of unmarked warehouse spaces near the Genessee River. There were a number of video installations in the space, so it was an inspiring environment for people to learn about video art, since they could see some cool applications of the medium at the same time. After the event, we visited the space of <a href="https://rathaus.press/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rathaus Press</a>, a risograph print studio run by Evan in an adjacent building.
  </p>
<p>
  We are already planning our next visit to Rochester and looking forward to getting involved with more of the cool things that are happening there. Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drhamburgerz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cameron</a>, Evan, and The Psychic Garden for having us.
