  A photo from a memorable, nearly-cancelled a/v performance at H0L0 in Ridgewood, Queens during a blizzard on January 4. The only other performers who were able to make it to the venue in the icy conditions were <a href="http://gryphonrue.com/ruebainbridge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rue Bainbridge</a>. A number of guests were also able to make their way through the snow to watch. The result was a very special and intimate atmosphere.
