I participated in a livestreamed performance with some friends at this year's edition of <a href="https://fubar.space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">/'fu:bar/ Glitch Art Festival</a>! The festival is usually held in Zagreb; this year it is fully online.

Our performance was titled *Recursive News* and used 1990's broadcast video equipment to re-interpret cable access style news broadcast into an echoing void of infinite recursion. We streamed live from the <a href="https://phasespace.xyz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Space</a> studio in Brooklyn.

Performance: ***Recursive News***<br/>
Who: Paloma Kop, Andrei Jay, Allen Riley, Rob Yohe, Irfan BrkoviÄ‡<br/>
When: Monday October 5, 2pm (NY time) / 8pm (Zagreb time)<br/>
Where: the internet
