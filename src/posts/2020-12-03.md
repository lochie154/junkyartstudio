  I performed an a/v set with an 8 foot weather balloon for the opening of <i>Edge of Light</i>, an exhibition curated by Jonathan Sims for HoloCenter. The opening performances were curated by Testu Collective. The opening took place on December 3 and our performances were streamed online.

  This was my first time incorporating this large spherical balloon into a live performance with analog video synthesis. I found that I was able to create a variety of weather patterns, as one might see on the surface of a gas giant planet.
