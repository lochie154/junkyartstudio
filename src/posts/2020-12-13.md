My online MFA thesis exhibition, ***SPACE(TIME) THRESHOLDS***, virtually opened on Sunday, December 13. This body of work was created during my studies in Electronic Integrated Arts at Alfred University from 2018-2020.

I also released the accompanying book, ***From Material Space(time) into Electronic Space(time)***, which serves as my written thesis and a window into my process. Printed books are available to order, and the digital PDF is linked as well.

I performed a livestreamed a/v set to celebrate and bring in a realtime component. It incorporated video and sound elements from the exhibition, manipulated and remixed live.
