Since my recent move to New Haven, CT, I now have a private room for my studio and work space. It's been a while since I've had a dedicated space for this purpose, so I was very excited to set up my things again.

I've had a number of studio spaces over the years, and even the ones I had for an extended period were prone to me moving everything around periodically, so I've gone through a lot of trial and error to find the best way to arrange things for my purposes. Since I work with a lot of AV equipment, I've felt the temptation — the same one I've seen others in this medium get pulled into as well — to create some kind of Ultimate Signal Chain where all of my gear can remain plugged in and patchable. This seems to work well for shared studios and recording spaces, but in my own space, I like to create bespoke setups for whatever my current projects require. For example, sometimes I want to use a bunch of electronic equipment, while other times I just need table space for drawing or doing something messy with inks or other liquids.

So I have decided that it's better to just keep a few things out on my desk by default:

- my desktop computer
- a television screen that accepts analog or digital inputs
- a multichannel audio interface
- some speakers
- a paper notepad
- my modular synths (including both audio and video modules; these aren't as ubiquitous at the other items in this list, but I like having a tactile synth playground available on short notice, and they are really annoying to put away and take back out)

If I want to use other equipment for a specific project or performance, I can bring it out and plug it in just for a few days or however long I need it for. There is even enough space in my room to set up additional folding tables to extend my surface area if needed. If I'm preparing for a performance, it is actually helpful to quarantine everything I'm bringing with me to a separate table anyway; it makes it easy to pack, and helps make sure everything will fit on the table I'm bringing.

With these methods in mind, my studio is organized around three areas:

- my desk (pictured and described above)
- shelves for storing equipment and supplies
- a nook with a beanbag chair for reading, and a meditation bench.

I do most of my reading on the couch and at the table in our living room, but I like having a private space to relax as well.

Below, you can find my attempt to draw my studio as an isometric video game level. There are a few things you can't see because they are on the cut-away walls: another window, a small closet, and several wall-mounted cable hangers for cables I need quick access to.

Here are a few other details about my desk setup:

- I added a triangle of wood to soften the inner corner of my L-shaped desk, and make it nicer to sit at my computer which is positioned diagonally in the corner.
- My desk has motors to adjust the height, but my modular synth case is best positioned vertically, so I built a wooden frame that attaches to the desk and provides a surface for it to lean against without touching the wall.
- The two chairs I use at my desk are a stool and a special chair that allows me to sit cross legged at my desk. I have found that using chairs without backs has greatly improved my posture and back pain.
- My split mechanical keyboard is also helpful for ergonomics, in addition to being fun and customizable. I made wrist rests for it by tying off a pair of socks filled with dried beans.
- I made a little organizer out of cardboard for storing shorter modular patch cables by draping them over one of my speakers.

I hope you enjoyed this virtual tour of my studio! I love seeing other people's spaces as well, so if you share yours, let me know.
