On Saturday, April 21, I performed video for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1763772500347301/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concert</a> at a church in Brooklyn, NY featuring ambient electronic music sets by Malcolm Cecil (formerly of TONTO's Expanding Head Band) and Steve Moore (of Zombi). I output two channels of live analog video, which corresponded to layers of projection mapping in the architectural environment. I loved helping to create such an immersive and transportive audiovisual experience, and I hope to incorporate projection mapping in future performances. Many thanks to <a href="http://ambient.church/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ambient Church</a> for inviting me.
