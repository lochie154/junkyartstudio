Thursday, February 29, was the opening of {% extLink "Silvering Toward Invisible", "https://www.lightsoutgallery.org/silvering" %}, a group exhibition at Speedwell Contemporary in Portland, ME, presented by {% extLink "Lights Out", "https://www.lightsoutgallery.org/" %}. The show features my audiovisual work along with photography (often of glowing spiderwebs in the dark) by {% extLink "Peah Guilmoth", "https://pguilmoth.com/" %}, minimal textured landscapes in charcoal by {% extLink "Emily Nelligan", "https://www.alexandregallery.com/artists-work/emily-nelligan" %}, and poetry by {% extLink "Kristen Case", "https://www.kristencase.com/" %}.

_**Silvering Toward Invisible** is driven by poetry, both visual and written. During this season the light is changing, and the warmth of the sun is slowly returning. We begin to hunger for spring, though it is months away. We look for evidence of its signs, but a thick white blanket of snow still covers the ground. We can see the contours of the landscape through the trees. At this time the world is at its most stark and elegant and takes on the impressions of our imaginations. This show will harness the returning light, the receding darkness, and the bare, suggestive quality of the landscape waiting to undergo monumental change. Viewers will encounter moments of brightness, velvety darkness, and a deep poetic primality waiting to erupt from beneath the surface._
