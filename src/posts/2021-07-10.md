On Saturday, July 10, <a href="https://phasespace.nyc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Space</a> hosted an evening of multimedia installations and performances called *PHOTON PLAYGROUND*. Phase Space is a diy multimedia art studio based in our basement in Bushwick. I also performed as part of a very vague band called New Delusion a.k.a. Nude Illusion.
