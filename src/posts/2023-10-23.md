  On October 23, we did a <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Shift</a> artist talk/workshop at <a href="https://calarts.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California Institute for the Arts</a> in Santa Clarita, CA. We visited a class called Creative Technology Forum with professor Josephine Shetty. <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrei</a> and I took turns showing some of our individual artwork and collaborations, and then the students tried out some of our video feedback setups in an interactive demo at the end.

  I was excited to see that the students in this class were very engaged with their own unique projects and art practices. They asked insightful questions which showed that what we were doing was relevant to their own work. I was impressed with the level of initiative and self-direction of the students, and the level of creative cross-pollination that seemed to be taking place within the class.

  Many thanks to Josephine for having us in her class and to Michael Bailey, audiovisual artist and CalArts student, for inviting us!
