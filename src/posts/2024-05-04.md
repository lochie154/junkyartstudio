On Saturday, May 4, Andrei and I returned to {% extLink "The Psychic Garden", "https://www.instagram.com/the_psychic_garden/" %} in Rochester, NY to perform live video and sound as REALITY ORP! Our friend {% extLink "Anna Oxygen", "https://annaoxygen.cargo.site/" %} (Ithaca) also performed a bumping synthwave set. Unfortunately {% extLink "Dr. Hamburger", "https://www.instagram.com/drhamburgerz/" %} was unable to perform, but fellow Rochester locals Shonen Book were able to hop on at the last moment with a fever dream of feedback-laden visuals mixed with Donkey Kong. It was a memorable night. Many thanks to {% extLink "Taimur", "https://bit-rot.bandcamp.com/" %} for holding down the Psychic Garden fort as well!
