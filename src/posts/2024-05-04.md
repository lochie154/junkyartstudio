  On Saturday, May 4, Andrei and I returned to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_psychic_garden/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Psychic Garden</a> in Rochester, NY to perform live video and sound as REALITY ORP! Our friend <a href="https://annaoxygen.cargo.site/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anna Oxygen</a> (Ithaca) also performed a bumping synthwave set. Unfortunately <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drhamburgerz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Hamburger</a> was unable to perform, but fellow Rochester locals Shonen Book were able to hop on at the last moment with a fever dream of feedback-laden visuals mixed with Donkey Kong. It was a memorable night. Many thanks to <a href="https://bit-rot.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taimur</a> for holding down the Psychic Garden fort as well!
