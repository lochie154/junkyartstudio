  On July 27th, I performed an experimental audio-visual set as sleepwalks at Secret Project Robot in Brooklyn. The show was organized by <a href="https://euglossine.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">euglossine</a>, an experimental musician from Gainesville, Florida. I enjoyed setting up a cave-like spatialized projection environment and filling it with warm synth sounds and evolving video textures.
