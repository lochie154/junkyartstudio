On September 17, we led our {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} *Intro to Live Visuals* workshop in Portland, Oregon, hosted by <a href="https://synthlibraryportland.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Synth Library Portland</a> and <a href="https://ceti.institute/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CETI</a>. Our attendees were an excellent group of videonauts, and we had a great time learning and experimenting. Many thanks to Jon Daries, Thomas Fang, Adam Sladek, and everyone else at CETI and Synth Library Portland who helped put this together!
