On Saturday, April 7, I organized the second edition of *Télépresence*, a yearly conference of analog video artists and evening of audio visual performance. I also performed as 1/2 of *Fugitive Dream Recovery*, a collaborative side project. We held a tabling session for artists to show the methods and devices they use to manipulate video signals, then hosted an evening of a/v performances.

It was amazing to hang with artists and engineers from all across the U.S. and Canada, and very rewarding to get the chance to help facilitate creative cross-pollination around the medium of video. Many thanks to everyone who helped make it happen.
