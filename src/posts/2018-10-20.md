On Saturday, October 20, I did a solo experimental a/v performance at *<a href="http://www.transientvisions.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transient Visions: Festival of the Moving Image</a>*, held at Spool Mfg. in Johnson City, NY. My performance closed out the festival following an evening of experimental film screenings.
