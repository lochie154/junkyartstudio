On January 26, I presented and discussed some excerpts of my audiovisual artworks at an event called *Sound* at {% extLink "Luck Dragon", "https://luckdragon.space/" %}, in Delhi, NY.

*Sound* is a monthly event at Luck Dragon, in which two artists or musicians present and talk about their work, followed by a period of group discussion. In this way, artists and sonic practitioners are brought into conversation with both each other, and the local community. The other presenter for this edition was Sam Tellman, who talked about his research and design journey toward creating {% extLink "https://www.sottoinstruments.com/", "a new kind of piano" %} that's more lightweight and user-serviceable.

Luck Dragon is an art supply shop that also hosts community events. It was cool to visit this space because the people who run it also have an open-source audio hardware company, a pottery studio, various artist spaces, and a private occult library in the same building. Delhi is about an hour west of where I'm currently based, so I'm hoping to spend more time there in the coming months. Thanks to {% extLink "Brian", "http://nnnnnnnn.co/" %} for inviting me.
