On Saturday, May 6, we hosted our last show at <a href="https://phasespace.nyc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Space</a> before moving out (more on that soon). I performed live ambient music for a collaborative a/v set with {% extLink "Andrei Jay", "https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" %} as REALITY ORP. Our friend <a href="https://groceries-store.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ÏãùÎ£åÌíàgroceries</a> did a set as well! As always, there were a variety of installations on view throughout the event, and we also had tarot readings.

We will miss organizing events here in Brooklyn, but our friends are taking over the space and continuing to do cool stuff there, while Andrei and I are hitting the road for a cross country tour. So this was also a bit of a going away party, and a final hurrah for Phase Space as we know it.
