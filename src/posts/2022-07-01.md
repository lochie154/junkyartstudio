On Friday July 1, I performed a collaborative audiovisual set with <a href="https://www.matthewryals.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matthew Ryals</a>. The video and sound was interactive via control voltage signals from Matthew's modular synthesizer interacting with my modified video hardware. The show was at Littlefield in Gowanus, and celebrated album releases by both Matthew Ryals and <a href="https://www.chloealexandra.info" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chloe Alexandra Thompson</a>. It also featured excellent performances from live-coder Melody Loveless, dark synthscaper Brian Wenner, and experimental electronic musician Chloe Alexandra Thompson.

In addition to our collaboration on the performance, Matthew Ryals and I also worked together recently on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ8XqnRcD8o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">music video</a> for one of the tracks of his new album, <a href="https://matthewryals.bandcamp.com/album/impromptus-in-isolation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Impromptus in Isolation</a>.
