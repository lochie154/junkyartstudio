On Friday, March 22, I did a set at Secret Project Robot in Brooklyn, along with 5 other amazing solo a/v acts. This was an exciting show for me because it brought together a group of artists who each have a unique approach to audiovisual performance. The show was co-organized by all the performers around a visit from Helsinki-based artist and educator <a href="https://macumbista.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Derek Holzer</a>.
