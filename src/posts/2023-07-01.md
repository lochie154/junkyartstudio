On July 1st, we led another {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} video art workshop in Iowa City at <a href="http://www.publicspaceone.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Public Space One</a>. I've never been to Iowa City before, so it was quite fun to meet so many folks there from the experimental art / noise music scene. We greatly appreciated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ph_sph_n_s/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PHOSPHENES</a> for booking the space and hosting us, and everyone who brought over gear for the workshop. I look forward to visiting again some time!
