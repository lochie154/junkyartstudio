<i>Post Analog</i>, an exhibition of new print and video works by me and fellow media artist Sara Goodman, opened on September 20th in Portland, OR! The show was curated by Sarah Turner, and will be up at Grapefruits Art Space until October 21. During the opening celebration, there was a live transmission-based sound performance by <i>drc // erc</i>, a collaborative duo of local experimental musicians Darcy Neal and Erin Cooper.
