On October 14, we led a {% extLink "Phase Shift", "https://phaseshift.zone" %} video art workshop at Cat Factory, a diy space in San Francisco. <a href="https://chipperswitch.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Evan Sirchuk</a> helped us organize it, and also invited us to visit the <a href="https://archive.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> where he works. We had more help and gear lending from Nathan Trachimowicz, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/555sounds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chris Farstad</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avfetz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fetz A/V</a>. Many televisions were activated with mesmerizing patterns, and fun and educational times were had by all.
