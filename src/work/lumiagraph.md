description: An installation with glass, lasers, and a modified record player
lightbox: true
---

Using a modified record player, a laser, and hand formed glass, I created a light installation which produces patterns of refracted light throughout a darkened space. The title is a combination of lumia (a term for light-based art coined by Thomas Wilfred in the early 1900s) and phonograph.
