      I am an experimental multimedia artist and creative technologist from the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. My practice incorporates electronic media, from analog video and synthesizers to digital systems and code, as well as various physical materials and processes. I am especially interested in feedback loops, recursion, self-organizing and emergent structures, patterns in nature, psychedelia, and embodied sensory experience.

    <p>
      I received an <a href="/mfa/">MFA</a> in Electronic Integrated Arts at Alfred University in 2020, and a BS in Visual Arts and Computer Science from Purchase College in 2014. I have shown work and performed at spaces and events such as Ambient Church (NYC), Eastern Bloc (Montréal), /'fu:bar/ Festival (Zagreb), Maverick Concert Hall (Woodstock), and Ann Arbor Film Festival (Michigan). I have done visiting artist talks and workshops at universities such as CalArts, NYU, and SAIC. I am also trained in vinyasa yoga and mindfulness meditation.

  <h2>
    Move Slow and Fix Things
  </h2>

  <p>
    As a practitioner of tech and electronic media, I try to counterbalance the cultural push towards compulsive productivity. I believe that technology should be used to enrich people's lives; dopamine-draining corporate social media networks, invasive data harvesting, and hype trains such as cryptocurrency and so-called "artificial intelligence" all serve interests contrary to humans' well-being and the environment. Under capitalism, companies are incentivized to use technology to manipulate and extract as much as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    DIY websites, decentralized networks, and creative communities inspire me to seek another path. A path that moves at a human speed, with space to breathe. One that values careful cultivation over explosive growth, thoughtfulness over conformity. Building and maintaining this website has become part of my exploration towards this path.
