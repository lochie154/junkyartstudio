### Current status

We found a new apartment in New Haven and are in the process of moving there, so I'll be pretty occupied with moving my things and setting up the new space for the next week or so. I'm looking forward to being within walking/biking distance of things again, after spending most of 2024 in the middle of the woods.

I also got a new lens for my camera and have been taking photos with it. It is very satisfying to shoot with a real camera. (People usually ask me what camera I have so I'll mention that it's a Sony a6000, and the lens is 35mm f1.8, which on this sensor is equivalent to about 50mm.)

I've been trying to post a new photo shot on my camera daily on {% extLink "izzzzi" "https://izzzzi.net" %}. (If you're on there, add me and let me know!)

I'm working on adding a bunch of pieces and collaborations from the last few years to the <a href="/work">portfolio section</a> of my website.
