# My personal website, built with Eleventy

This repo houses the source files for my website, which is built with the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) static site generator. I didn't use a starter template, but I re-used code from the older [plain html version of my site](https://github.com/palomakop/palomakop.github.io). The site is hosted on Netlify and automatically rebuilds when I commit to this repo.
